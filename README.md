# uSTL

**This library is obsolete. Please use the official gcc C++ standard library.**

uSTL is a partial implementation of the C++ standard library that focuses on
decreasing the memory footprint of user executables. While some projects can
use it to replace the standard library without any code changes, there exist
important differences that you should be aware of. Please read documentation
in [docs/index.html](https://msharov.github.io/ustl) before using this
library in your project.

Then, after you've read it, consider whether you really want to make your
project depend on a nonstandard standard library to get almost nothing for
the trouble. uSTL is no longer significantly smaller than the standard
library, but continues to have numerous incompatibilities that were required
to get those space savings twenty years ago. So when I ask you to just use
the standard library, I really do mean it!

## Installation

The only dependency is a C++ compiler, gcc 5 or clang 3.6.
Build configuration is in Config.mk and config.h, generated by configure.
`configure --help` will list available configuration options.

```sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make check
make install
```

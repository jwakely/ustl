# uSTL

**This library is obsolete. Please use the official gcc C++ standard library.**

uSTL is a partial implementation of the C++ standard library that focuses on
decreasing the memory footprint of user executables. While some projects can
use it to replace the standard library without any code changes, there exist
important differences that you should be aware of. Please read documentation
in [docs/index.html](https://msharov.github.io/ustl) before using this
library in your project.

The only dependency is a C++ compiler, gcc 3.4 or clang 3.2. C++14 support
requires gcc 5 or clang 3.6. Build configuration is in Config.mk and
config.h, generated by configure. `configure --help` will list available
configuration options.

```sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make check
make install
```
